                <h2>Our Journey: Why We Created This Resource</h2>
                <p>Posted on March 28, 2025 by Josh Benedict & Donald</p>
                
                <p>It all began during our final semester at Cebu Eastern College. As we approached next Year-level, we reflected on our journey as Easternians and remembered how confusing the enrollment process had been when we first started. We recalled the numerous questions we had about curriculum choices, requirements, and deadlines.</p>
                
                <p>The idea for this website was born during our professor asked for a website . Donald mentioned how his younger cousin was struggling to understand the enrollment process for SHS, and Josh shared similar stories from family friends who were confused about CEC's curriculum offerings. We realized that despite the wealth of information available, many prospective students and their families found it difficult to navigate the enrollment process.</p>
                
                <p>"What if we created something that would simplify this for future Easternians?" Josh suggested.</p>
                
                <p>That night, we decided to combine our final project with something truly meaningful â€“ a comprehensive resource that would help prospective students understand CEC's enrollment procedures and curriculum offerings. We wanted to create more than just another school website; we wanted to build a bridge between the institution we loved and the students who might one day call it home.</p>
  
                <p>This website represents more than just a school project; it's our way of giving back to the CEC community that shaped us into who we are today. We hope that through this resource, future generations of Easternians will find their path with greater ease and confidence.</p>
